## Announcement

Updated 2025/08/06

The SLAM interface has undergone a comprehensive overhaul, with most interfaces being significantly revised, now only compatible with version 1.1.7. Added support for Go2-W interfaces.

Updated 2025/06/09:

For the updating of 20250606.

The SLAM update applies to the entire docking station system, so be sure to back up before updating:

If you've already performed SLAM navigation, simply save the following files from this directory:

/unitree/module/graph_pid_ws/config_files/:

graph_process_config and lio_sam_config

Just back up these two files and restore them after the updateâ€”leave everything else unchanged.

## What is this?
